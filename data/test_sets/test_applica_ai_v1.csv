"highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to ""reserves_policy"" that should be reviewed by a lawyer","The School’s reserves policy is to maintain sufficient unrestricted income reserves to enable it to meet its short-term financial obligations in the event of an unexpected revenue shortfall, and to rely on the readily realisable investments of the School’s general purpose expendable endowment as adequate cover for the School’s longer-term capital expenditure commitments and any longer-term financial obligations. This includes the actuarially calculated but transient funding deficit of £4.5 million on the School’s defined benefit staff pension scheme that, under FRS102, is accrued as a liability. The School’s total reserves of £45.6m at the year-end included £38.7m permanent endowment, £5.5m of restricted funds and £5.9m of unrestricted funds after adding back the £4.5m pension fund deficit mentioned above. After excluding unrestricted fixed assets with a net book value of £1.4m, it leaves free reserves of £4.5m. The Governors consider this position appropriate in view of the School’s development plan and available working capital update. The capital expenditure is reviewed by Governors and the funding decisions are part of this planning process. The primary use of additional unrestricted funds generated over the period of the development plan will therefore be to provide funds for new capital projects. These funds will not increase the level of free reserves of the School as they will be represented by fixed assets. In addition, it is expected that the timing of the funds generated over this period will match the timing of the capital expenditure, thus leaving minimal additional free reserves at any stage over this period. In considering their reserves policy, the Governors consider matters such as working capital and the reserves required for unexpected but unavoidable items of expenditure which cannot be funded from current income. The Governors are satisfied that the current position of free reserves is acceptable and in accordance with the policy. This policy will be monitored by the Governors’ Finance and General Purposes Committee and reviewed annually. "

We have promised in our senior debt indenture to limit these preferential rights on voting stock of any designated subsidiary, called liens, as discussed under “—Restrictive Covenants—Limitation on Liens and Other Encumbrances on Voting Stock of Designated Subsidiary”. If a merger or other transaction would create any liens on the voting stock of our designated subsidiary, we must comply with that restrictive covenant. We would do this either by deciding that the liens were permitted, or by following the requirements of the restrictive covenant to grant an equivalent or higher-ranking lien on the same voting stock to the direct holders of the senior debt securities. The junior subordinated indenture generally permits a consolidation or merger between us and another entity. It also permits the conveyance, transfer or lease by us of all or substantially all of our property and assets. These transactions are permitted if: Ÿ the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than us, is organized and existing under the laws of a domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes by a supplemental indenture to the junior subordinated indenture the payment of all amounts due on the debt securities and performance of all the covenants in the junior subordinated indenture on our part to be performed or observed; and Ÿ certain other conditions as prescribed in the junior subordinated indenture are met.

"highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to ""auditor_opinion"" that should be reviewed by a lawyer","I have identified a matter of concern in my report because I have concerns that there may have been material loss to the charity arising as follows. The trustees became concerned about the level of administrative costs and sought justification of the costs being charged to the charity. As a result of the trustees not being satisfied with the explanations given, the person responsible left the company and a second, more junior person left abruptly before they could be questioned. Both people had been retained on a self-employed basis (i.e. they were not on the payroll and were not classed as employees). It is not clear whether this matter is materially significant under section 156 of the 2011 Act but it has been reported to the relevant authorities by the trustees and is quite likely to have been financially material in its effect on the charity. I confirm that no other matters have come to my attention in connection with the examination giving me cause to believe that in any material respect: 1. accounting records were not kept in respect of the company as required by section 386 of the 2006 Act; or the accounts do not accord with those records; or 3. the accounts do not comply with the accounting requirements of section 396 of the 2006 Act other than any requirement that the accounts give a “true and fair view” which is not a matter considered as part of an independent examination; or 4. the accounts have not been prepared in accordance with the methods and principles of the Statement of Recommended Practice for Accounting and Reporting by Charities applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102).
